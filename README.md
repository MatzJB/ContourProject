# Contour Project

Author: Matz JB

## Overview
This project implements a 2D Contour class that can store and manipulate a sequence of connected segments. 

It is written in C++17 using Visual Studio 2022. It is recommended that you use that.

It showcases test functionality of Visual Studio. GTest was considered, but was ultimately not picked for this project.

A segment can be either a line or an (circular) arc. The project is written in a way that future extension for additional segment types is possible.

The Contour class is designed to support flexible construction, iteration, and validation of contours, while maintaining high performance through caching (**Contour::isValid**) and avoiding unnecessary calculations (**sqrt** for distance). Additional performance can be achieved using vectorization, which is not explored here.

## âœ¨ Features

The Contour class provides a robust and extensible framework for working with connected 2D geometric segments. Its design supports both current functionality and future extensibility with performance and usability in mind.

#### Config header
Contains macros for constants and things that affect the whole project, for instance REAL is a macro used to override the type of all the coordinates in the project.

#### Contour class:

Stores a sequence of 2D segments (**Line**, **Arc**, etc.).
Allows adding, inserting, and removing segments.
Supports copying and moving operations.
Provides read and modify access to individual segments via iteration.

#### Segment types:
A segment can be a **Line** or an **Arc**.
Additional segment types can be added easily at compile time.

### ðŸ”¬ Validation:

The contour is considered valid if all consecutive segments are connected end-to-begin within a small epsilon tolerance.
Validation is calculated on demand and cached to avoid redundant computations. 
Contours are validated using the isValid() function to ensure proper segment connectivity. Edge cases and mixed segment types are also tested to verify the robustness and reliability of the contour implementation.

### Utility Functions:

Function for creating a Contour from a series of points interpreted as a polyline (**contourFromPoints**).

## Multithreaded Testing:

Constructs multiple hardcoded Contour instances (both valid and invalid).
Uses asynchronous tasks to search for valid and invalid contours in parallel.
Ensures that all original contours are correctly classified.

### Write to SVG file
To debug the contours you might want to export them to SVG format and open them using InkScape.
Some shapes (contours) were generated by the test function. It shows contours of arcs only, lines only and a mix of the two.

## Future Improvements

CMake Integration: Transition project to use CMake for building and configuration.

Google Test (GTest): Integrate Google Test for unit testing in Visual Studio.

Doxygen: Configure Doxygen for automated documentation generation.

Additional Segment Types:

* Add support for B-splines, clothoids, and polygons as new segment types.

Advanced Contour Operations:

* Implement resampling, simplification, and turtle graphics for more complex contour processing.

Caching Optimization:

* Extended caching to cover additional computationally expensive properties, such as SSE (Summed Square Error).

Contour Visualization:

* Integrated Qt for contour visualization, aiding in debugging and inspection.
