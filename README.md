# Contour Project

Author: Matz JB

## Overview
This project implements a 2D Contour class that can store and manipulate a sequence of connected segments. 

It is written in C++17 using Visual Studio 2022. 

## Build Instructions
Run build.bat, it will call cmake and create the build directory along with ContourProjectMain, ContourLib and ContourTests. ContourLib is generated because we use it in the other projects.
Gtest is used and downloaded when building with cmake.

## What contours?
A contour consists of a vector of items where items can be Lines or Arcs. Everything is in 2D. The project is written in a way that future extension for additional segment types is easily added. The Contour class is designed to support flexible construction, iteration, and validation of contours, while maintaining high performance through caching (**Contour::isValid**) and avoiding unnecessary calculations (we do not calculate **sqrt** for distance for instance). Additional performance can be achieved using vectorization, which is not explored here.

## âœ¨ Features

The Contour class provides a robust and extensible framework for working with connected 2D geometric segments. Its design supports both current functionality and future extensibility with performance and usability in mind.

#### Config header
Contains macros for constants and things that affect the whole project, for instance REAL is a macro used to override the type of all the coordinates in the project.

#### Contour class:

Stores a sequence of 2D segments (**Line**, **Arc**, etc.).
Allows adding, inserting, and removing segments.
Supports copying and moving operations.
Provides read and modify access to individual segments via iteration.

### ðŸ”¬ Validation:

The contour is considered valid if all consecutive segments are connected end-to-begin within a small epsilon tolerance (see in config.h **EPS**).
Validation is calculated on demand and cached to avoid redundant computations. 
Contours are validated using the **isValid()** function to ensure proper segment connectivity. Tests are divided into files for each category.

### Utility Functions:

Function for creating a Contour from a series of points interpreted as a polyline (**contourFromPoints**).


### Write to SVG file
To debug the contours you might want to export them to SVG format and open them using InkScape.
Some shapes (contours) were generated by the test function. It shows contours of arcs only, lines only and a mix of the two.

## Future Improvements


### Necessary
- [x] CMake Integration: Transition project to use CMake for building and configuration.

- [x] Google Test (GTest): Integrate Google Test for unit testing in Visual Studio.

- [ ] Doxygen: Configure Doxygen for automated documentation generation.

### Additional Segment Types:

- [ ] B-splines
- [ ] clothoids
- [ ] polygons as new segment type.

### Advanced Contour Operations:

- [ ] Resampling
- [ ] **simplification**
- [ ] turtle graphics tape (inspiration from my course ARK385)

- [ ] Investigate optimization (SSE, assembly, BSP)

### Contour Visualization:

- [ ] Integrated Qt for contour visualization, aiding in debugging and inspection.
